Remixing Ethically: A Note from the Author
This code is licensed under the MIT License to ensure compatibility with GitHub’s systems.

However, I ask that you engage with it as a learning resource, not a copy-paste template.
Feel free to remix, reinterpret, and rebuild — but do not replicate it word-for-word or use it commercially without permission.

Respect the voice embedded in the logic. Remix with care. Credit when inspired.
